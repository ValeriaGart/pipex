env - lists env variables.
    The purpose is: to communicate to programms about how the machine is set up
    and sometimes to control the behaviour of programms.

getenv("NAME OF SEARCHED LINE") - works as $(env | grep "NAME OF SEARCHED LINE")

waitpid - better than wait because u can use it as wait by passing -1 as 3d arg and u can do much more.
    3d arg of ft: < -1 - for process group id
                 == 0  - waits for specific pid
                 > 0   - waits for all child processes of current group id
    + flags !!!!
